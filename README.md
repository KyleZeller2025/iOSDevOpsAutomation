# iOS DevOps Automation

A production-grade macOS app for iOS DevOps automation that provides comprehensive project inspection, CI/CD pipeline configuration and security scanning.

## Features




### 🚀 CI/CD Pipeline Management
- Multi-platform pipeline generation (GitHub Actions, Jenkins, GitLab CI, CircleCI, Bitrise, Azure Pipelines, Buildkite, TeamCity, Codemagic, Travis CI)
- Pipeline validation and configuration
- Template-based generation with deterministic output
- Support for custom steps and environment configuration

### 🔒 Security Scanning
- Comprehensive security analysis
- Vulnerability detection and reporting
- Code quality and best practice validation
- Automated remediation suggestions





## Architecture

The app follows Clean Architecture principles with hexagonal boundaries:

- **Domain Layer**: Pure Swift types with no external dependencies
- **Application Layer**: Use cases and business logic orchestration
- **Infrastructure Layer**: Adapters for external systems and providers
- **Presentation Layer**: VIPER pattern with Coordinator for navigation

### Key Design Principles

- **MVVM with Unidirectional Data Flow**: Views are passive, ViewModels handle business logic
- **Protocol-Oriented Design**: Capabilities defined as protocols, concrete types injected at composition boundaries
- **SOLID Principles**: Single responsibility, open/closed, Liskov substitution, interface segregation, dependency inversion
- **Concurrency**: `MainActor` for UI, `ProcessRunner` actor for serialized process execution
- **Security**: Security-scoped bookmarks, no hardcoded secrets, TLS 1.2+ only



### Requirements

- macOS 15.0+
- Xcode 16.0+
- Swift 5.9+

### Build from Source

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-org/iOSDevOpsAutomation.git
cd iOSDevOpsAutomation
```

2. Open the project in Xcode:
```bash
open iOSDevOpsAutomation.xcodeproj
```

3. Build and run the project (⌘+R)

## Usage

### Main Interface

The app provides a clean, intuitive interface with the following sections:

1. **Project Information**: Displays selected project details including name, bundle ID, version, and path
2. **Action Buttons**: Four main actions for DevOps automation
3. **Results Display**: Shows analysis results and generated content
4. **Status Bar**: Displays current operation status and progress

### Getting Started

1. **Select a Project**: Click "Select iOS Project" to choose an Xcode project (.xcodeproj or .xcworkspace)
2. **Analyze Project**: The app automatically analyzes the selected project and displays information
3. **Generate Pipelines**: Click "Generate CI/CD Pipelines" to create pipeline files for multiple platforms
4. **Run Security Scans**: Click "Run Security Scans" to perform security analysis
5. **Generate Report**: Click "Generate Report" to create a consolidated report

### Project Analysis

When you select an iOS project, the app will:

- Parse the Xcode project file
- Extract project metadata (name, bundle ID, version, etc.)
- Analyze dependencies and build settings
- Identify test targets and schemes
- Check code signing configuration
- Display a comprehensive project summary

### CI/CD Pipeline Generation

The app can generate pipeline files for multiple CI/CD platforms:

- **GitHub Actions**: Complete workflow files with matrix builds
- **Jenkins**: Pipeline as Code configuration
- **GitLab CI**: GitLab-native pipeline configuration
- **CircleCI**: Orb-based configuration
- **Bitrise**: iOS-specific workflows
- **Azure Pipelines**: YAML-based configuration
- **Buildkite**: Agent-based execution
- **TeamCity**: Kotlin DSL configuration
- **Codemagic**: iOS-focused workflows
- **Travis CI**: YAML-based configuration

### Security Scanning

The security scanning feature provides:

- Static code analysis
- Dependency vulnerability scanning
- Code quality assessment
- Security best practice validation
- Automated remediation suggestions

### Performance Profiling

The performance profiling feature includes:

- Memory usage analysis
- CPU performance monitoring
- Network request tracking
- Battery impact assessment
- Frame rate monitoring
- Performance recommendations

### Consolidated Reporting

The reporting feature generates comprehensive reports including:

- Project analysis summary
- Security scan results
- Performance metrics
- CI/CD pipeline validation
- Recommendations and next steps

## Development

### Adding New Features

1. **Domain Layer**: Add new entities, value objects, or enums
2. **Application Layer**: Create new use cases and interfaces
3. **Infrastructure Layer**: Implement adapters and providers
4. **Presentation Layer**: Add new views and coordinators

### Code Style

The project follows strict Swift style guidelines:

- Swift naming conventions
- Immutability by default
- Protocol-oriented design
- Comprehensive documentation
- Error handling with typed errors
- No force unwrapping in production code

### Testing

- Unit tests for domain and application layers
- Integration tests for infrastructure adapters
- UI tests for critical user flows
- Mock objects for external dependencies

## Security & Privacy

### Security Features
- Security-scoped bookmarks for persistent folder access
- Local-only analysis with no data transmission
- Secrets redacted in logs and reports
- TLS 1.2+ for all network communication
- Certificate pinning for first-party servers

### Privacy Considerations
- No personal data collection or transmission
- All analysis performed locally
- User consent required for file access
- Secure storage of sensitive information
